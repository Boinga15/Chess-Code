# Chess-Code
A chess-based esoteric language that uses Python as a compiler.

Chess Code is an esoteric language where you use Chess moves to program. Note that these moves will never follow an actual chess game, plus some of the symbols are derivatives of actual chess moves.

Open the "code.txt" file and write code in it. For a guide on how to write the code, visit ___ for more information.

To run the compiler, run the compiler.py file or type "py -m compiler" into a command prompt window.
